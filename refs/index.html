A new kind of cell phone plan - talk over your WiFi when you can, with Sprint network as a backup, plans from $10 unlimited talk text.
Their referral program is currently on hold while they rework it, but I still like their prices.

  <td><a href="https://trello.com/aricaumann/recommend">Trello</a> - organize lists / cards / projects.  I use it for work and personal "todo" lists.
  Referring gets 1 mo. free "Gold" status - someting about stickers, I don't really care, but I like the site and the Android app a lot.
  </td>

<tr><td><a href="http://assembla.com">Assembla</a> for developers - project hosting (git/svn/perforce) and management tools combined.
    They might have an affiliate program, but this link is just to the homepage.  I use a free 3 users / 1 project account, it's mostly 
    clean.
