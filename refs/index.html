I recently moved from the cable company to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.verizon.com/home/MLP/ReferAFriend.html?refcode=AUMAN005VZ">Verizon Fios</a> 
<p /> If you are switching to FIOS anyways, a referral earns both parties some points for their rewards program. Amount varies based
 on what services are ordered.

A new kind of cell phone plan - talk over your WiFi when you can, with Sprint or T-Mobile network as a backup, plans are very reasonable.
Their referral program is decent.  Referred and referring each get $20 off a future bill. On the 1Gig plan, that is a month of service for 1 line.

<a target="_blank" href="https://listia.com/r21ep0p/DCXVQR">Listia</a><p />
Listia is like a low-key ebay with virtual currency. Most physical items require real money for shipping, but I've mostly used
  it to collect digital copies of movies from people who aren't going to redeem them. This site recently switched from an internal point system
  to a cryptocurrency called INK Protocol (trades as XNK) that they are hoping to pick up usage of, making it much more difficult to just buy some credits for
  their offerings, since it now runs through external exchanges. I assume they'll sort out the complexities eventually. Both parties get 25 INK, 
  currently worth less than 1 cent.

Switch to bing for your web searches, and you can get about $5/month in Amazon credit, or some other popular retailers.  Referred gets 200 pts, Referring gets 200 pts (~$2 in rewards).
If you use Hulu Plus, it's possible to earn enough points every month to keep a free subscription.<p />

<a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/aricaumann/recommend">Trello</a> <p />
  Organize lists / cards / projects.  I use it for work and personal "todo" lists.
  Referring gets 1 mo. free "Gold" status - someting about stickers, I don't really care, but I like the site and the Android app a lot.
